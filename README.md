# octopus-telemetry

This is the future web telemetry for SONIA

## Installation

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd src
npm install
```

⚠️ If it does not work, it is possible that you don't have the latest CRA version...it's normal. There is a [known bug](https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/2128). To [resolve this](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/9964) for now:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

## Starting the UI

```bash
cd src
npm run start
```
